# Tailwind CSS Unexpected Styling Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered in Tailwind CSS where expected styles are not applied correctly. The issue stems from a conflict between CSS classes or an unexpected specificity problem.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a solution.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js`. Observe that the styling of the div element is not as intended (it may lack the expected background color, padding, shadow, or other styles).

## Solution

The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` addresses the conflict by using more specific CSS classes, appropriately overriding existing styles, or resolving any discrepancies in the Tailwind configuration.
